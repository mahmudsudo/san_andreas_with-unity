# San Andreas Unity




San Andreas Unity is an open source reimplementation of GTA San Andreas game engine in Unity.

This isn't a complete reimplementation, but the focus is on gameplay features, mutliplayer, and creating a framework which will allow easy game extending and unlimited modding possibilities.


When running for the first time, the game will ask you for path to GTA installation. You need to own GTA in order to play it.


## Download



The game is tested on Linux, Windows, Mac, and Android. It supports both Mono and IL2CPP scripting backends, so it can be built for any platform that Unity supports, provided that you can copy PC version of GTASA to target device.


## Multiplayer

Game fully works in multiplayer. You can start the game as dedicated server, as a host (server & client at the same time), or you can connect to a server. This works on all supported platforms, which means you can start a host even on Android device.

If you want to host a server, take a look at [command line instructions](https://github.com/GTA-ASM/SanAndreasUnity/wiki/Command-line) and [server administration](https://github.com/GTA-ASM/SanAndreasUnity/wiki/Server-administration).
